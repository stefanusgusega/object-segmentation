# Object Segmentation Project
This is the repository for Task 3 of Image Processing and Interpretation : Object Segmentation using MATLAB

## 💁‍♂️ What is this project about?
We implement many operations to do object segmentation by detecting edge using gradient-based and laplacian-based approach. Gradient-based approach such as Sobel, Prewitt, Roberts, and Canny, and Laplacian-based such as Laplacian and Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG). We also implement object segmentation operations from edge images to separate the object from its background. Also, there is a GUI for those operations, so it can load image that you desire. This project is implemented using MATLAB.

## 🏃‍♂️ How to run the GUI?
1. Make sure you've installed MATLAB on your device.
2. Go to ```src/``` folder.
3. Double-click ```app.mlapp```.
4. A window will be opened and the GUI is being run and every tab is already initiated with images.
5. Sample images for every task can be found in the 'images' folder.
